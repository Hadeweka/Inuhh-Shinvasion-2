# Inuhh-Shinvasion-2

Another project I may never finish.
Will hopefully prove to be a successor to the first Inuhh Shinvasion game.

This time with the Shidacea-Engine, combining SFML for better performance and mruby for nice scripting in Ruby.

Necessary build tools (executables need to be in path variable on Windows):

* CMake (e.g. Visual Studio on Windows)
* Ruby
* GNU Bison

This repository will be developed parallel to the Shidacea Engine.
