# Inuhh-Shinvasion-2

Another project I may never finish.
Will hopefully prove to be a successor to the first Inuhh Shinvasion game.

This time with the Shidacea Engine, combining SFML for better performance and mruby for nice scripting in Ruby.

Necessary build tools (executables need to be in path variable on Windows):

* CMake (e.g. Visual Studio on Windows)
* Ruby
* GNU Bison

# Note

The development of this repository will continue after finishing the Shidacea Engine.

See https://github.com/Hadeweka/Shidacea for progress.
