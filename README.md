# Inuhh-Shinvasion-2

Another project I may never finish.
Will hopefully prove to be a successor to the first Inuhh Shinvasion game.

This time with SFML for better performance and mruby for nice scripting in Ruby.

Implemented features yet:

* Included SFML and mruby
* Implemented support for Ruby scripts compiled into bytecode

Features I'm currently working on:

* Template magic for wrapping C++ classes into Ruby classes
* Collision routines
