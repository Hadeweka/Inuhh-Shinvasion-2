# Inuhh-Shinvasion-2

Another project I may never finish.
Will hopefully prove to be a successor to the first Inuhh Shinvasion game.

This time with the Shidacea-Engine, combining SFML for better performance and mruby for nice scripting in Ruby.

Implemented features yet:

* Included SFML and mruby
* Implemented support for Ruby scripts compiled into bytecode
* Template magic for wrapping C++ classes into Ruby classes
* Basic wrappers for some SFML classes

Features I'm currently working on:

* Map routines
* Simple state machine for scenes
* Exporting the Shidacea-Engine into a separate repository

Things I will eventually do:

* Game physics
* Basic game logic
* Implement 
* Collision detection routines
* Implement support for Tiled and ImGui
